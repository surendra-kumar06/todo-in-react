# Todo List Application

A simple and interactive Todo List web application built with React. This app allows users to add, update, delete individual tasks, and delete all tasks at once. It uses browser `localStorage` to persist the tasks so that your tasks remain saved even after refreshing the page.

## Features

- **Add tasks**: Add tasks to the list by entering them in an input field.
- **Edit tasks**: Click the "Edit" button to modify a task's content. The input field auto-focuses when you enter edit mode.
- **Delete tasks**: Remove individual tasks from the list.
- **Delete all tasks**: Clear all tasks with one click.
- **Persist tasks**: Tasks are saved in `localStorage`, so they persist between page reloads.

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: React.js
- **State Management**: React Hooks (`useState`, `useEffect`, `useRef`)
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS (Utility-first CSS framework)
- **Icons**: `react-icons` for icons (e.g., Edit, Delete)
